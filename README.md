# San Francisco COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Map

## Development files
To make development easier and test that the code is reliable, we have a few extra files in this directory. We use the javascript development tool [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) to interact with them.

## Running locally

Install the node dependencies for testing and serving our files:

```
yarn install
```

Start a server where you can view the index.html page:
```
yarn start
```

You should now be able to see the sample map at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

If you don't see a map, make sure you have added your access token in index.html.
